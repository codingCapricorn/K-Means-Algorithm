# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## An Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm

Clustering is arranged in a way that each observation in the same class possesses similar characteristics and observation of separate groups shows dissimilarity in characteristics. As a part of the unsupervised learning method,clustering attempts to identify a relationship 


K-means algorithm explores for a preplanned number of clusters in an unlabelled multidimensional dataset, it concludes this via an easy interpretation of how an optimized cluster can be expressed.
